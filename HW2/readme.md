# Overview
This homework is implementing the DCT, DST and KLT and examine their decorrelation efficiency. 
A very important takeaway is that DCT and DST are largely the same. In the dstmtx.m, change the generation matrix will change whether
the transformation matrix is DCT or DST, more specifically, can be any types of DCT or DST based on different bounday conditions. Details 
is shown in the lecture notes.
